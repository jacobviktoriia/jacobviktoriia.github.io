        <h2>Our Journey</h2>
        <p>Hey Everyone!</p>
        <p>It's Jacob and Viktoriia. We're getting married! We'd like to share this special season of life with you. We went through lots of planning, multiple changes of plans due to visas, and everyday work/life obstacles that made all this near impossible. But with God, all things are possible through prayer and petition.</p>
        <p>So what's the plan that God has showed us? First, we'd like to invite all of you to join us virtually to witness the exchange of our wedding vows. Due to visa challenges, this would allow both our immediate families to be present as we say "I do".</p>
